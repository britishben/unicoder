# unicoder
This program takes an integer, converts the base, and outputs a string of unicode characters, starting at the point given.

I created this to make a quick "secret text" encoder.

Eventually, this will handle text strings as well, and support decoding, I just haven't needed that functionality yet.

unicoder.py is the console version, and unicoder_g.py uses tkinter to create a graphical version.
